# Hospital Management System 🏥

Simple static hospital management web UI built with plain HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This repository contains a set of static pages (no backend) that demonstrate a hospital management front-end: login, dashboards for admin/doctor/patient, and appointment pages.

## Features

- Clean, responsive HTML & CSS UI
- Separate dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and Patient
- Asset organization for CSS and images

## Project structure

- `index.html`, `login.html`, `doctor-dashboard.html`, `patient-dashboard.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`
- `assets/css/` for styles
- `assets/img/` for images

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder using a static server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code Live Server).
2. Navigate through the available pages to preview the UI.

## Development

- Edit HTML/CSS files in `assets/` and refresh the browser to see changes.
- Consider moving to a proper build tool or adding a backend when you need dynamic data.

## License

If you want this to be open-source, add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT). If you'd like, I can add an MIT license now.
